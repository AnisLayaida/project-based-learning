# Data Types & Variables: Understanding the Concepts
from operator import truediv

# Variable -> Stores information to use later on, when it is called on

# Data Types:
# Integer -> year = 3131, the number 3131 is an integer (a full number)

# Float -> pi = 3.141592654, the number 3.141592654 is a decimal, (not a full number), hence called a float

# String -> message = "Good Morning", usually anything wrapped in "" or '' is stored as a string

# Boolean -> late-to-class = false, booleans are true or false statements

# Examples of all data types assigned to a variable:
name = "Anis" # String
age = 20 # Integer
female = false # Boolean
bank_account = 4324.24 # Float

# Reading List
# Lists are used in python to store multiple values under one function. With lists, come list values.

readingList = ["Harry Potter", 1984, "The Fault in Our Stars", "The Mom Test", "Life in Code"]

readingList.append("Pachinko") # Used to add a value at the front of a list
readingList.remove("The Fault in Our Stars") # Used to remove a specific index in an already existing list
print(readingList)
